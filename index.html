      <h2>Why a sustainable water management is needed?</h2>
      <p>
        Water is life. Yet, as the world population mushrooms and climate change
        intensifies droughts, over 2 billion people still lack access to clean,
        safe drinking water. By 2030, water scarcity could displace over 700
        million people. From deadly diseases to famines, economic collapse to
        terrorism, the global water crisis threatens to sever the strands
        holding communities together. This ubiquitous yet unequally distributed
        resource underscores the precarious interdependence binding all nations
        and ecosystems and shows the urgent need for bold collective action to
        promote global water security and avert the humanitarian, health,
        economic, and political catastrophes that unchecked water stress
        promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the southern part of Madagascar which is subject to recurrent
        droughts, access to clean water is limited. It often leads to famine and
        malnutrition. This situation underscores the need of an efficient water
        management and sustainable infrastructure.

      <h2>How to save water inside the household</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend less time in the shower</li>
        <p>
          To save water in the shower, aim to get your shower time down to 4
          minutes or less. Use a shower timer or your favourite 4-minute song to
          time your showers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Momentarily switching off the shower when you donâ€™t need the water to
          flow, like when youâ€™re soaping up, shampooing or shaving can also save
          you lots of water.
        </p>
        <li>Brush teeth at the sink, not in the shower</li>
        <p>
          Did you know, brushing your teeth in the shower can use more than 9L a
          minute? While it may seem like the waterwise thing to do, brushing
          your teeth in the sink is much more efficient. You only need a few
          seconds to wet your toothbrush and rinse after use, so itâ€™s best to
          stick with the sink.
        </p>
        <li>Switch to a water efficient showerhead</li>
        <p>
          The type of showerhead you use makes a huge difference when it comes
          to saving water in the bathroom. By installing a water efficient
          showerhead, your household can save up to 20,000L of water per year.
          Make sure to look for the stars on the WELS label. The more stars, the
          more water efficient the showerhead is. Be sure to also look at the
          flow rate (litres per minute) as this can vary substantially. To be
          considered water efficient, a showerhead must use 9L of water or less
          per minute.
        </p>
        <li>Regularly check for leaks to fix</li>
        <p>
          Check and repair faucet leaks and save up to 53 liters of water per
          week.
        </p>
        <li>Flush water smartly</li>
        <p>
          When using the toilet, use partial flush for urination or light use
          and full flush only for heavier use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toilets made before 1993 use 3.5 to 8 gallons per flush (gpf).
          High-efficiency toilets manufactured after 1993 use 1.6 gpf. Newer
          high-efficiency toilets use 1.28 gpf and dual-flush toilets use even
          less. The date of manufacture of most toilets is printed on the
          underside of the tank lid. A family of four can save 14,000 to 25,000
          gallons per year by switching from conventional toilets to the newer,
          more efficient ones.
        </p>
        <li>Collect Rainwater</li>
        <p>
          Recovery systems capture rainwater from the roof and redirect it to a
          storage tank. This water is used for flushing toilets, supplying
          cooling towers and irrigating the landscape. The Region 7 Science and
          Technology Center in Kansas City, Kansas, has incorporated a
          state-of-the-art rooftop rainwater recovery system that has the
          potential to save the laboratory more than 300,000 gallons of water
          per year.
